Place all of your answers in a single word processing document and `upload as a PDF`.

Clearly **label each answer** with the corresponding question letter.

---

### Part A. Graph (4 points)
Use Graph Creation Software [Graph Online](https://graphonline.ru/en/) (or similar) to create and draw a
weighted and directed graph that has a minimum of eight vertices and twelve edges. 
Use a “real-world” scenario for your sample data. **Must have node names for your vertices** (not numbers).
Describe the scenario in 1 paragraph. List the name of the software you used to create your diagram.
Export your graph as an image or use screen capture to place your graph in your report

---

### Part B. Adjacency-list Graph Implementations (4 points)
Show how your graph could be represented using an adjacency-list. Show the symbol table and
inverted index for names for each node if applicable. Describe the storage requirements (ie.
number of bytes) for your graph. See diagrams from class and
[Geeks for Geeks Graphs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-and-its-representations/)

---

### Part C. Adjacency-matrix Graph Implementations (4 points)
Show how your graph could be represented using an adjacency-matrix. Show the symbol table
and inverted index for names for each node if applicable. Describe the storage requirements (ie.
number of bytes) for your graph. See diagrams from class and
[Geeks for Geeks Graphs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-and-its-representations/)

---

### Part D. Part E. Breadth-First Search (2 points)
Create and show all of the breadth-first paths for your graph. Pick a logical starting vertex for
your graph. You will use the same starting vertex in Part E.

---

### Part E. Depth-First Search (2 points)
Create and show all of the depth-first paths for your graph. Use same starting vertex as Part D.

---

### Part F. Minimal Spanning Tree (4 points)
Create and draw two minimal spanning trees for your graph. Assume your graph is (un)directed
for this question. Use Prim's algorithm for the first and Kruskal's algorithm for the second.
Describe the order that edges are added for each algorithm. What is the cost of each tree?

---

### Part G. Dijkstra's Algorithm (5 points)
Show a trace of Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm using your graph. Use the same starting vertex
as Parts E and D. Your trace should be similar to our class example. Find and list a link to an
outside resource (ie. web-page or short video) that describes the algorithm.

---

### Part H. Bellman-Ford Algorithm (5 points) 
Show a trace of Bellman-Ford shortest-path algorithm using your graph. Use the same starting vertex as Part D and E. Your trace should be
similar to our class example. `Find and list a link to an outside resource` (ie. web-page or short
video) that describes the algorithm.
