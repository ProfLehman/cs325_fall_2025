# Lab #7– Sorting - 30 Points
## Due: Wednesday, October 22th at 5 pm.

The purpose of this assignment is to gain an understanding of three of the most common sorting algorithms: **Bubble**, **Selection**, and **Insertion** sort. Each of these sorts is O(N2).  


## Step 1 – Pick Random Data
Pick **seven (x7) random numbers** between 1 and 100 for your sample data.  You will use this same data set for all of the examples.  Begin by ordering the numbers randomly ie.   70  30  44   80   20   10   60
Note: your data should not be sorted at this point.


## Step 2  - Sort Data (x3 pages, show each sort on a separate page, use plenty of white space)
Show how each of the algorithms **Bubble**, **Selection**, and **Insertion** sort would sort the data chosen in step 1. Show each pass in the algorithm and clearly indicate all “swaps”.  Each algorithm requires N-1 passes.   Count and show the total number of swaps and comparisons required to sort your data.


## Step 3 – Sort Sorted Data (x3 pages, show each sort on a separate page, use plenty of white space)
Show how each of the algorithms Bubble, Selection, and Insertion sort would sort the data chosen in step 1 if the data were already sorted in ascending order ie. 10 20 30 40 60 70. Show each pass in the algorithm and clearly indicate all “swaps”.  Each algorithm requires N-1 passes. Count and show the total number of swaps and comparisons required to sort your data.


### Clearly label each sort.  Use 8.5  x 11 inch paper, no zuzzy edges. Submit paper copies of your sorts. You should have a total of six pages.

Note: You may choose to code these algorithms for fun :-) or to check your answers, but are not required to write code for this assignment. 
You can also find algorithms online, including the Geeks for Geeks site as well as Prof. Lehman’s sortDemo program posted on Moodle.
