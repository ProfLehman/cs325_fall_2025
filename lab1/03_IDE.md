# Java IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)

While you can write and run Java from the **command line**, many developers use an **IDE**.  
An IDE provides features like code completion, debugging, and project management.

Here are some common IDEs for Java:

---

## Visual Studio Code
- **Website**: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
- Lightweight, cross-platform editor from Microsoft.  
- Requires installing the **Java Extension Pack**.  
- Works well for beginners and advanced developers.

## Eclipse
- **Website**: [https://www.eclipse.org/ide/](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/)  
- One of the most widely used Java IDEs.  
- Large ecosystem of plugins.
