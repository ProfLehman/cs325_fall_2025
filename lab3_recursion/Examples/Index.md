# Recursion Examples in Java

This collection demonstrates classic recursive functions in Java. Each page includes a short overview and runnable code sample.

## Examples

### recursion1.java
- [CountDown](CountDown.md)  
- [CountUp](CountUp.md)  
- [Factorial (int)](FactorialInt.md)  
- [Factorial (long)](FactorialLong.md)  
- [Binary](Binary.md)  
- [BaseN](BaseN.md)  
- [Backward](Backward.md)  
- [Backward With Helper](BackwardWithHelper.md)  
- [Backward Return](BackwardReturn.md)  
- [CountIf](CountIf.md)  
- [NeverEnd](NeverEnd.md)  

### recursion2.java
- [CourseWork (hours recursion)](CourseWork.md)  
- [Array Total (with helper)](ArrayTotal.md)  
- [Count Greater Than N (with helper)](ArrayGreaterThan.md)  
- [Array Average (with helper)](ArrayAverage.md)  

### recursion3.java
- [CourseWork (hours recursion)](CourseWork.md)  
- [Array Total (with helper)](ArrayTotal.md)  
- [Count Greater Than N (with helper)](ArrayGreaterThan.md)
