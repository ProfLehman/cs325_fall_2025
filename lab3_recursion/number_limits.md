# Towers Problem

Limits of storage in Excel, Java, and Python.

Excel stores numbers in IEEE 754 64 bit floating Point format.

# Java (long)

The maximum Java long value is (2^63)-1 = 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

Running the following Java code, we can see that the  largest number we can calculate is 2^62 = 4,611,686,018,427,387,904


```java
public class test {

    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        long a = 1;

        for (int n=1; n <= 64; n++)
        {
            a = a * 2;
            System.out.printf("2^ %10d = %,30d  %,30d%n", n, a, a - 1);
        }

    }
}
```

# Python
Python (version 3) allows integers to grow as large as needed and is only constrained by memory and computation time rather than a fixed bit width.
```python
a = 1
n = 1
while n <= 64:
    a = a * 2

    print(f"2^{n:>10,} = {a:>30,} {a-1:>30,}")
    n = n + 1
